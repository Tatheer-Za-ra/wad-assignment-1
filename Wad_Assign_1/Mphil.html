                    The objective of M.Phil Computer Science programme is to train students to initiate research work. The duration of M.Phil programme is two years (4 semesters).
<br>
MPhil is of 50 credit hours, 24 credit hours for the course work and 26 credit hours for research work. Each course is of 3 credit hours. There are 2 compulsory courses, and 6 optional courses are taken to complete 24 credits. The courses are designed in such a way that during the course work students will be exposed to research activities. The course work will set the basic ground work to start research.
<br>
Students will register for a research topic in the 3rd semester and will complete the research work by the end of the 4th semester. The research work will be submitted in the form of a thesis.
                </p>
