                        In today's Information Society, expertise in all forms of information is required for progress
                        in science, business, and education. The main aim of MS programme in Information Science &
                        Technology (IST) is to design and develop information related applications using information
                        technology by understanding relationship between digital information, people and technology. The
                        MS programme intends to bring together Computer Science and collaborative environment of how
                        people and society interact with digital information MS (Information Science & Technology) Part

                        Data Science has become an important due to the need for analyzing and understanding ever
                        increasing data generated by a multitude of sources. By getting admission in the MS programme
                        applicants will not only improve their qualifications but will also be equipped with the latest
                        knowledge in the field. The students will be exposed to different aspects of data science
                        including programming, data structures, and algorithms for data science, data analysis and
                        visualization, and big data analytics. These aspects will provide the students the opportunities
                        to effectively work in local and international markets as well as to pursue a PhD degree in data

                        The BS Computer Science program at QAU provides a well-integrated balance of theoretical and
                        practical knowledge required for developing reliable and usable software tools for different
                        fields. The program enables students to design, implement and manage systems combining
                        scientific, computational, communication and multimedia facilities in different domains. The
                        main objective of the program is to provide students with a balanced breadth and depth of
                        knowledge in Computer Science that enables them to begin their professional career in the
                        software industry or they can continue their education at graduate level. In the final three
                        semesters, students enhance their skills and knowledge in one of the following focus areas:
