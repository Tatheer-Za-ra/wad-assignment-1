                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                The BS Computer Science program at QAU was started in 2013. It provides a well-integrated balance of
                theoretical and practical knowledge required for developing reliable and usable software tools for
                different fields. The program enables students to design, implement and manage systems combining
                scientific, computational, communication and multimedia facilities in different domains. The BS program
                is accredited by National Computing Education Accreditation Council (NCEAC).

             <h2>   BS Program Structure</h2>
                During the B.S. students will be informed through research expertise of the faculty about the current
                and future issues affecting the usage and development of computer-based systems. Initially students
                learn basics of computing discipline through foundation courses and will build their knowledge of the
                discipline through core courses. In the last four semesters students will extend their knowledge in a
                focus area of their choice through elective courses. The final year compulsory project will give
                students the opportunity to consolidate and demonstrate the knowledge and skills gained from the entire
                course material.

                <h2>Focus Areas</h2>
                After providing the students with a solid foundation based on foundation and core courses in Computing,
                the BS program will give students the opportunity to enrich their knowledge in an area through elective
                courses. These elective courses will on one hand provide in-depth knowledge, and on the other will
                enable students to work on and solve practical problems in the area by using latest techniques and
                tools. Some focus areas are:
<ul>
               <li> Artificial Intelligence</li>
               <li>Data Science</li>
               <li>Software Engineering</li>
               <li>Human Centered Computing</li>
               <li>Information Systems</li>
               <li>Networks and Security</li>
                </ul>
              <h2>  Courses Overview</h2>

                Four years of BS program is divided into eight semesters. In each semester, students are offered 15 to
                18 credit hours of courses, where one credit hour means one hour of teaching (or three hours of lab) per
                week. The students have to complete 130 credit hours during their degree. The courses are divided into
                six groups:
<ul>
               <li><strong> Computing Core</strong> courses mainly focus on the core concepts of the computing discipline. These courses are
                also studied by students of other computing domains like Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Software
                Engineering, etc. </li>
                <li> <strong>Domain Core</strong> courses are related to the theoretical computer science. These courses develop the
                foundational concepts of the computer science domain.</li>
                <li> <strong>Domain Elective </strong>courses allow students to specialize in their field of interest like Artificial
                Intelligence, Deep Learning, Mobile Application Development, Software Engineering, Web Development, etc.
                They are offered in the last four semesters.</li>
                <li><strong> Maths and Supporting </strong>courses develop the mathematical foundation.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Elective Supporting </strong>course allows students to gain knowledge in supporting disciplines like social and
                management sciences.</li>
                <li> <strong>General Education</strong> courses give a breadth of knowledge to the students covering subjects like English,
                Mathematics, Physics, Ethics, etc.</li>

            </ul>
